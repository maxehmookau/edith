Magic Macbook Provisioning - Ansible playbooks for Ruby developers on Mac.

## What's this?

I was bored of spending a day setting up a new laptop. So I figured the best way to deal with it was to automate the process. By using this you will get the following:

* Git
* Chrome
* Homebrew
* Cask
* Sequel Pro
* RVM/Ruby
* Rails
* Sublime Text, configs and the Anonymous Pro font
* Vagrant
* Loads of sensible OS X configs.

## Provision!

1. Open `inventory.ini`
1. Alter the variables as required. (Will run on localhost by default)
1. `$ ./provision.sh`
1. Make a cuppa.
